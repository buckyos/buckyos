The implementation of the account module is divided into three phases:

Phase 1: Develop a basic runnable account module, including an account storage and private key management module for testing purposes, allowing dependent modules to make calls. (One week)

Phase 2: Once the configuration storage within the Zone is completed, implement the account-related functions within the Zone.

Phase 3: Implement centralized account-related functions.
